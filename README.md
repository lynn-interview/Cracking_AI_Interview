💡 Why This AI Interview Guide?
I built this repo because I was once just like you: a self-taught explorer struggling to find my way.

I fell into countless traps and absorbed every open-source tutorial I could find from giants like Karpathy and Andrew Ng. But I discovered a critical problem: I had seen the material, but I hadn't truly understood it.

This "shallow understanding" fell apart during interviews. When an interviewer drilled down into the details, I could only stumble through the concepts I had memorized.

🧠 The 'Genius' vs. 'Mortal' Gap
I don't have a traditional AI or CS background.

B.S.: Biomedical Engineering

M.S.: Robotics and Autonomous Systems

I taught myself AI purely because I found it incredibly useful for my job.

For me, the brilliant thought process of someone like Karpathy wasn't a natural fit. The biggest challenge for a self-learner is building a systematic framework from scratch.

🎯 This Repo's Core: The 80-to-95-Point System
This repo is my answer—the systematic framework I built for myself.

This way of thinking helped me make a quantum leap:

With rote memorization: I could get an 80/100 (maybe Top 20% of the class).

With deep, integrated understanding: When it all finally "clicked," I could score a 95/100 and be a Top 3 student.

I genuinely hope this framework and system can help you truly get AI, not just memorize interview talking points.
